# Operating System Installation
These are the steps for installing an OS:
1. [Create Installation Media](#create-installation-media)
2. [Create Partition Table](#create-partition-table)
3. [Format Partitions](#format-partitions)
4. [Install Windows](#install-windows)
5. [Install Linux (Optional)](#install-linux)

Note that you will need a Product Key (license) to use Windows unless you
already have Windows installed on the machine; in that case, it will
know that you had/have a licence when you reinstall Windows.

Also note that UEFI is better than Legacy BIOS and GPT is better than MBR.
Additionally, do not attempt to use MBR with UEFI boot, and also do not
attempt to use a GPT disk with BIOS (or Legacy) boot. Technically, the latter
is possible, but unless you know what you are doing, will only cause
headache. So, even though there is an option in Settings
to Reset the computer (wipe hard drive and reinstall Windows), you might
not want to use that because it might use Legacy BIOS with MBR (and the
Reset option failed every time I tried it - but that might not be common);
and by doing things manually, you can sometimes convert an old machine to
UEFI boot.

## Create Installation Media (USB)

### Linux
1. Download image file: Google search "\<distro> \<flavor> iso" (e.g. "ubuntu 22.04 budgie iso") and
    you should find it easily enough
1. Plug in the USB you wish to use (make sure it has enough space to hold the image file)
1. Figure out what device the USB drive is on (e.g. `/dev/sda`) by running `lsblk`
1. Flash the USB (or partition) with the image file: `sudo dd if=<image file>.iso of=/dev/<device> oflag=sync conv=fdatasync bs=4M status=progress`
1. Now you can boot into that USB

### Windows
You probably need to be on a Windows machine to do this (although it might be
possible with Wine). Follow
[this guide](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-create-a-windows-10-installation-media/ad10cb15-1848-40f6-a6ad-094f902f669a) or watch
[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DXzr3eXkd4). The software
downloads page can be found
[here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) (only
works on Windows machines - otherwise webpage can only download ISO).
When following the guide above, choose the option at the end to use a USB flash
drive rather than an ISO file (you need an 8GB flash drive or bigger).
If you are comfortable enough with computers, just download the ISO and
[Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) (I prefer the "portable" version). Use Rufus to
flash your USB flash drive with the ISO image, deselecting the option that says
something to the effect of "create auto start files".

Once the image is flashed to the USB flash drive, the installation media is
generic for all versions of Windows 10, so you need
to figure out which index in `sources\install.esd` matches the version you
want to install. After your USB flash drive is ready:
  - Open up File Explorer on a Windows machine
  - Navigate to the `sources` folder on your flash drive
  - Click `File` -> `Open Windows PowerShell (as administrator)`
  - `dism /Get-WimInfo /WimFile:install.esd` (list all indices)

Here are the results when I did this:
```bash
Index 1: Windows 10 Home
Index 2: Windows 10 Home N
Index 3: Windows 10 Home Single Language
Index 4: Windows 10 Education
Index 5: Windows 10 Education N
Index 6: Windows 10 Pro
Index 7: Windows 10 Pro N
```

This Index is important and will be used later. Note down the index number
pertaining to the license you previously had on your computer, or for which
you bought a retail license.

If you want to create an installer for 1 specific index:
  - `dism /export-image /SourceImageFile:install.esd /SourceIndex:<choose index #> /DestinationImageFile:install.wim /Compress:max /CheckIntegrity`
  - (do not include <> when choosing the index number, e.g. `/SourceIndex:1`)
  - Be careful how much memory you have when creating `install.wim` (~4GB for Index 1)

## Create Partition Table
If you are going to use Windows and Linux on the same hard drive, then create
partitions for Windows first.

<aside class="warning">
Warning: Careful, the following steps will destroy access to all data on your disk!
</aside>

### 1. Zap (erase) current partition table
  - Boot into a Linux Live ISO flash drive (Ubuntu and Arch linux are good choices)
  - Enter the following commands in a shell:
    - figure out which device corresponds to the drive
    - substitute sda with device found above
    - get into expert menu
    - zap the drive - you will have to confirm multiple times
    ```sh
    $ lsblk
    $ sudo gdisk /dev/<sda>
    Command (? for help): x
    Expert command (? for help): z
    ```
### 2. Create new partition table (GPT)
  - continuing in the shell:
    - enter the `gdisk` program
    - create a new GPT table - accept confirmations
    - write the new GPT table to disk - accept confirmations
    - poweroff to guarantee a reset of the cache in the booted system that holds the partition layout
  ```sh
    $ sudo gdisk /dev/<sda>
    Command (? for help): o
    Command (? for help): w
    $ systemctl poweroff
  ```
### 3. Add partitions for EFI and Windows
  - Boot into a Linux Live ISO flash drive and type the following in a shell
  - `sudo gdisk /dev/<sda>` (same device as before)
    - `n` (create new partition)
    - `ENTER` (use default partition #)
    - `ENTER` (use default start location)
    - `+256M` (allocate next 256MB for partition)
    - `ef00` (EFI)
    - `n` (create new partition)
    - `ENTER` (use default partition #)
    - `+32M` (leave 32MB empty space after last partition)
    - `+16M` (allocate next 16MB for partition)
    - `0c01` (Microsoft reserved)
    - `n` (create new partition)
    - `ENTER` (use default partition #)
    - `+32M` (leave 32MB empty space after last partition)
    - `+<500G>` (choose size for Windows partition)
    - `0700` (Windows basic data)
    - `n` (create new partition)
    - `ENTER` (use default partition #)
    - `+32M` (leave 32MB empty space after last partition)
    - `+3G` (allocate 3GB for partition)
    - `2700` (Windows Recovery)
    - `p` (print table and verify it is correct)
    - `w` (write changes)
  - `sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/<sda1> -n ESP` (Format EFI partition you just made)
  - `systemctl poweroff` (reboot after writing to partition table)

### Format Partitions
  - Already formatted the EFI partition while booted into Linux
  - Boot into Windows flash drive
  - Open Command Prompt as administrator
    - `Shift + F10` (if that doesn't work, do the following steps)
    - Click `Next` to get past 1st screen
    - Click `Repair your computer` to bring up more options
    - Click `Troubleshoot`
    - Click `Command Prompt`
  - `diskpart` (open disk partion menu)
  - `list disk` (display all drives - don't need but can use to verify info)
  - `select disk <#>` (select a disk from the list)
  - `list disk` (verify correct disk was selected, asterisk should not be present)
  - `list volume` (display all partitions/drives) -> use regularly to verify steps
    - Make a note of the letter assigned to your Windows flash drive (need it later)
  - `select volume <#>` (select EFI partition - should see * appear using `list volume`)
    - `format quick fs=fat32 label=System` (Don't need to do this -> did on Linux earlier)
  - `assign letter="S"` (give it a letter for easy access later)
  - `list volume` (verify changes)
  - `select volume <#>` (select Windows partition)
  - `format quick fs=ntfs label="Windows"` (format partition)
  - `assign letter="W"` (change letter to W)
  - `list volume` (verify changes)
  - `select volume <#>` (select 3GB Windows Recovery partition)
  - `format quick fs=ntfs label="Recovery Tools"` (format partition)
  - `assign letter="R"` (change letter to R)
  - `list volume` (verify changes)
  - `exit` (leave `diskpart` menu)

### Install Windows
  - Should still be in Command Prompt on Windows USB from formatting partitions
  - `dism /Apply-Image /ImageFile:<I>:\sources\install.esd /Index:<1> /ApplyDir:W:\`
    - Use the letter assigned to your Windows flash drive for image file (e.g. `/ImageFile:I`)
    - Use the index of the Windows version you want, 1 is Windows 10 Home (e.g. `/Index:1`)
    - Can use `install.wim` instead of `install.esd` if you created it -> index would be 1 (installer for 1 version only)
  - `W:\Windows\System32\bcdboot W:\Windows /s S:`
  - `md R:\Recovery\WindowsRE`
  - `copy W:\Windows\System32\Recovery\winre.wim R:\Recovery\WindowsRE\winre.wim`
  - `W:\Windows\System32\reagentc /setreimage /path R:\Recovery\WindowsRE /target W:\Windows`
  - `exit` (leave Command Prompt)
  - Power off and reboot into Windows partion to go through setup
    - You will need a Product Key if you didn't already have Windows on the computer
    - I selected option to not use internet for setup
    - I don't allow location services or any of the other privacy options
    - I just create local accounts rather than signing into my Microsoft account

### Install Linux
This is optional if you want to add a Linux partition on the same hard drive
where you installed Windows.
  - Boot into the Linux Live ISO flash drive and open Terminal
  - `lsblk` (figure out which device you want put Linux on)
  - `sudo gdisk /dev/<sda>` (use the device you found)
    - `p` (print - should see the EFI and 3 Windows partitions)
    - `n` (create new partition)
    - `ENTER` (use default partition #)
    - `+32M` (leave 32MB empty space after last partition)
    - `-64M` (go until 64MB left on drive - don't use the last little bit)
    - `8300` (Linux filesystem)
    - `p` (print - verify changes)
    - `w` (write changes)
  - `systemctl poweroff` (reboot after writing to partition table)
  - Boot last time into the Linux Live ISO flash drive and run installer
    - When option comes up to install Ubuntu, select "Something else" for manual control
    - Format your Linux partition as ext4 and mount to /
