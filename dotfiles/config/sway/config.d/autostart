# --------- Startup Applications ---------- #
### Idle configuration

## xss-lock
# xss-lock grabs a logind suspend inhibit lock and will use i3lock to lock the
# screen before suspend. Use loginctl lock-session to lock your screen.
# exec --no-startup-id xss-lock --transfer-sleep-lock -- i3lock --nofork

## swayidle
# Example configuration:
# exec swayidle -w \
#          timeout 300 'swaylock -f -c 000000' \
#          timeout 600 'swaymsg "output * power off"' resume 'swaymsg "output * power on"' \
#          before-sleep 'swaylock -f -c 000000'
# This will lock your screen after 300 seconds of inactivity, then turn off
# your displays after another 300 seconds, and turn your screens back on when
# resumed. It will also lock your screen before your computer goes to sleep.

#          timeout 90 'exec foot -a "lock_asciiquarium" -T "lock_asciiquarium" -e asciiquarium &' \
# asciiquarium screensaver at 90s, lock at 300s, shutoff monitors at 600s
exec swayidle -w \
   timeout 200 'screensaver_start' \
     resume 'screensaver_stop' \
   timeout 300 'swaylock' \
     resume 'screensaver_stop' \
   timeout 400 'swaymsg "output * dpms off"' resume 'swaymsg "output * dpms on"' \
   before-sleep 'swaylock'
## test block
# exec_always swayidle -w \
#          timeout 5 'screensaver_start' \
#              resume 'screensaver_stop' \
#          timeout 10 'swaylock' \
#              resume 'screensaver_stop' \
#          timeout 15 'swaymsg "output * dpms off"' resume 'swaymsg "output * dpms on"' \
#          before-sleep 'swaylock'

### Notifications
exec fnott
# exec swaync

### Network
# NetworkManager is the most popular way to manage wireless networks on Linux,
# and nm-applet is a desktop environment-independent system tray GUI for it.
# exec --no-startup-id nm-applet

### Scratchpads
# launch scratchpad windows when i3 starts up
exec $term_named spad_normal
# exec $term_named spad_math -e $HOME/.pyvenvs/default/bin/ipython3

# Signal
# exec signal-desktop


### Chrome Apps
# These come from installing a website as an app (click button at the end of the
# search bar in chrome). This creates a desktop file in ~/.local/share/applications.
# Look inside of the created desktop file for the Exec command and copy it here.
# The app-id is determined by chrome and is in that Exec command.
# --profile-directory is to specify with which profile to launch the app, but it
# is NOT the profile name. Chrome refers to each profile by its own name:
# "Default", "Profile  1", etc.
# Find the profile name by running `my_chromium_profiles` from ~/bin

# get profile directories with the following (it is not the same as the profile name)
# jq -r '.profile.info_cache | to_entries[] | "\(.key): \(.value.name)"' \
#   ~/.config/chromium/Local\ State

# Teams
exec $browser --profile-directory=Default --app-id=cifhbcnohmdccbgoicgdjpfamggdegmo %U

# Outlook (BYU)
exec $browser --profile-directory=Default --app-id=pkooggnaalmfkidjmlhoelhdllpphaga %U
